          "question": "Why should I choose MD course?",
          "answer": "While there is a slight bias in favour of specialisations among MDs , General Medicine nevertheless holds its own. Its popularity has increased for a number of valid reasons. Here is a list of arguments that can persuade you to choose General Medicine if you are still debating it. General Medicine has numerous applications in the field of Medicine, in contrast to specialists who concentrate on just one particular patient demography. It can act as a gateway to many other medical specialities thanks to its wide scope of interest. According to numerous reports, there is a growing need for general practitioners."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the merits and demerits of doing an MD course in general medicine?",
          "answer": "General medicine, alias internal medicine, comes with its set of merits and demerits in choosing an MD . Merits: Scope of Knowledge: An MD in general medicine confers knowledge on a wide variety of medical conditions, diagnostic techniques, and treating options in the different organ systems. Versatility: A general medicine MD is trained in the diagnosis and management of a wide range of disorders and diseases; hence, they are versatile doctors in treating a broad spectrum of the needs of patients. Foundational to Specialization: An MD in general medicine thus will be a good foundation for one who would later like to specialize in one area of medicine. Holistic Approach: Internal medicine is concerned with the 'holistic approach' while undertaking patient care. It encompasses the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of several diseases and disorders in the adult patient population. Career Opportunities: Students attaining an MD in general medicine have a wide scope of career opportunities, from primary care practice to hospitalists, from academic medicine and research fields to healthcare administration. Demerits: Heavy Workload: Residencies in internal medicine largely go in correlation with heavy work hours and loaded patient caseloads, predisposing residents and practitioners to burnout. Broad Scope of Practice: Though the broad scope within Internal Medicine may be viewed as a merit, this is sometimes considered a demerit for those practitioners who get overwhelmed by the depth of knowledge required in various medical conditions. Limited Specialization: Though the general medicine course imparts broad-based fundamentals, it lacks the in-depth specialization offered by other medical specialities with a narrower scope. Complex Patients: The internal medicine physician tends to deal with complex cases medically, hence intellectually stimulating but emotionally tiring."
